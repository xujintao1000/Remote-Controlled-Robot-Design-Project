# Remote Controlled Robot Design Project
 Design and construct a remote controlled robotic vehicle. Video of the vehicle will be transmitted to a cellphone in real-time using WI-FI or cellular network for driving the robot from far. The robotic vehicle is intended to be driven in doors for cargo delivery purposes or as toy. Some AI techniques can also applied to the robots.
